    "a) At first glance, it looks like there is an interaction between degree and years of experience since it looks like the Masters line is not parallel to the other lines. However, upon further observation, I believe that the Masters data has an outlier that is a very influential point affecting the slope of that line. If we were to remove the data point at around 20 years of experience, I suspect that the 3 lines would be almost parallel.
