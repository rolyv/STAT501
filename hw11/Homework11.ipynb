    "a) The matrix plot shows that savings has a strong correlation with age and a strong correlation with income. It also shows that age has a strong correlation with income. It suggests that an MLR model with both predictors will have larger standard error for the estimated coefficients and marginal (if any) contribution to reducing the error sum of squares from the second predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Insert matrix plot of income savings age]\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The residuals vs fits plot for this model look good. The visual inspection suggests equal variances. The lack of linearity isn't obvious, but there is a subtle up-down-up pattern in the data. The normality test for the residuals confirms that they are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Insert residuals vs fits plot for savings vs age]\n",
    "[Insert prob plot for savings vs age residuals normality test]\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The residuals vs fits plot shows that the up-down-up pattern from the previous model is actually accentuated by adding the income predictor to the model. The variances appear equal, however. And the normality test confirms that they are normally distributed.\n",

    "[Insert prob plot for savings vs age/income residuals normality test]\n",
    "\n",
    "d) From the model in part (c), age and income both had the same VIF value of 29.29. This indicates a high level of correlation between the two predictors. This suggests that the MLR model that includes these two predictors would have less precision of the estimated regression coefficients. The estimated coefficients will be dependent on each other and have different values than from independent SLR models. We can mitigate these problems by removing one of the predictors from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Comparing this matrix plot with that from part (a), it looks like agenew and incomenew are highly correlated, but slightly less so than the age and income from part (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Insert matrix plot of savingsnew, agenew, incomenew]\n",
    "\n",
    "f) The residuals vs fits plot still shows the up-down-up pattern from previous plots. It looks however, that now the variance is no longer equal. It seems less at the ends and greater in the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Insert residuals vs fits plot for savingsnew vs agenew and incomenew]\n",
    "[Insert prob plot for savingsnew vs agenew and incomenew]\n",
    "\n",
    "g) From the model in part (f), agenew and incomenew both have the same VIF value of 2.48. This indicates a slight level of correlation between the two predictors, but nothing that would warrant further investigation according to the rule of thumb given in the notes. It appears as though the regression pitfalls have been mitigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "h) I believe that the model generated by adding the $agenew^2$ term has addressed the linearity issues of the previous models, but it still seems to have non-equal variances, larger in the center and smaller at the ends. The probability plot confirms that the errors are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Insert residuals vs fits plot for savingsnew vs agenew, incomenew, agenew^2]\n",
    "[Insert prob plot for savingsnew vs agenew, incomenew, agenew^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "i) The VIFs in the previous part are 94.15 for agenew and 92.51 for $agenew^2$. This indicates a strong correlation between these predictors that could affect the precision of the estimated coefficients, as well as causing the estimated coefficients to be dependent on each other. We can remove one of the predictors to mitigate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "j) The residuals vs fits plot of this model looks identical to that from part (h). The regression equation has changed slightly since the agenewc column has a different range of values. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Insert residuals vs fits plot for savingsnew vs agenewc, incomenew, agenewc^2]\n",
    "[Insert prob plot for savingsnew vs agenewc, incomenew, agenewc^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "k) The VIFs for agenewc and $agenewc^2$ are 2.5 and 1.01, respectively. It would appear that the pitfalls from part (i) have been mitigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "l) The prediction of savingsnew for an individual with agenew = 30 and incomenew = 45, using the model from part (h), is 58.0455. Using the model from part (j), is 58.0455. Both models arrive at the exact same prediction which makes sense since we saw that multicollinearity doesn't have a huge impact on predictions especially for values close to the means of the predictors.

    "a) The plot of StopDist vs spdmn19 shows a strong positive correlation between the variables. The relationship appears to be non-linear since it's curving upwards. The variance in StopDist also seems to increase as spdmn19 increases. \n",

    "f) The plot of studentized residuals vs fits looks much better than the previous plot in terms of correcting the error variance. This plot appears much closer to a horizontal band with constant variance. There does still appear to be a denser concentration of data points for smaller fitted values, and gets sparser for larger fitted values. \n",
